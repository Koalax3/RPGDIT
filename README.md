# RPGDIT
RPGDIT is a Hub project created for EPITECH

The purpose of the project is to permit people not possessing sufficient montage or drawing skills to make RPG character sheets to create their own, for their RPGs.

The application revolves around two libraries: REACTJS and FABRICJS

Adding elements to the sheet is easy:

First, click on the element type you want in the menu (background, skills). Then, click on the element you want, and it will automatically be placed on the sheet.

You can resize and rotate elements afterwards, always directly on the sheet.

The TEXT button lets you integrate values, titles, etc. to your sheet. You can also change the color or font of the text.

SELECT and DELETE button are available to modify or delete elements.

.PDF EXPORT and .PNG EXPORT buttons let you save and print your sheets (donâ€™t forget to unselect everything before, or cursors and modification elements will be exported with them).

The EXPORT JSON button allows you to save your work in a local file, in JSON format.

The IMPORT JSON button allows you to load a saved file.

This tutorial is finished,

Enjoy!
